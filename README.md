<!-- First image was created using text2img with Stable Diffusion v1.4. Final result was created using a mix of img2img loopback from the initial image and inpainting to fix details and create new backgrounds. I used SD v1.5 with [Automatic1111's Stable Diffusion web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), specifically [Inkpunk Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/Envvi/Inkpunk-Diffusion) to get the style. -->
